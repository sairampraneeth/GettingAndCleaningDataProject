## Github Repository Files
The Repository contains the following files :- 

1. "run_analysis.R" script which downloads the data, cleans it and then outputs a tidy data set in a file named "TidyData.txt"

2. Readme file named "README.md" for instructions on how to run the "run_analysis.R" script.

3. "CodeBook.md" file which describes the data sets as well as the transformations performed on the data sets to acquire the tidy data set.

## Steps Required for getting clean data set

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
